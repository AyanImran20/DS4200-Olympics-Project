      <h2>Data Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our combined dataset includes 35,000+ medal-winning athlete records covering the Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to the most recent edition. 
        We merged three primary sources: the summer.csv, athlete dataset, the dictionary.csv country metadata (including GDP per capita and population),
        and the ISO_Codes.csv country code lookup. After merging and cleaning, the final table has more than 10 features (including Year, City, Sport, Event, 
        NOC/Country, Athlete Name, Medal Type, Gender, GDP per Capita, Population). This rich structure enables exploration of country performance, gender participation, 
        sports/ events trends, and socio-economic correlates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We integrate this file with <code>Dictionary.csv</code> (country metadata,
        GDP per capita, population) and <code>ISO_Codes.csv</code> (standardized
        country codes) to create a combined <strong>OLYMPICS Dataset</strong> that
        connects athlete performance to country-level characteristics.
      </p>

  <h2>Static Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    This section presents static charts created in Python (Altair/Matplotlib)
    to provide an overview of Olympic medal trends.
  </p>

  <div class="viz-grid">

    <!-- Visualization 1 -->
    <article class="viz-card">
      <h3>Medal Counts by Country Over Time</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        Line chart showing how medal totals for major countries evolve across different Olympic years.
      </p>

      <img

        class="viz-img" 
        alt="Medal counts by country over time"
      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        This visualization shows how global dominance in the Olympics has shifted over time. 
        The United States consistently leads total medal counts, while countries such as the Soviet Union 
        and China emerge as strong competitors in specific eras. Major geopolitical events — including 
        wars, boycotts, and national sports investments — strongly influence these trends.

      <h3>Gender Participation by Year</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        Stacked bar chart summarizing male vs female athlete participation over Olympic history.

        src="figures/gender_participation.png" 
        class="viz-img" 
        alt="Gender participation by year"
      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        Gender participation in the Olympics has risen dramatically over the last century. 
        While early Games were almost exclusively male, the number of female athletes grew sharply 
        after the 1970s. This reflects global gender equality movements and expanded Olympic policies 
        that increased women's access to competitive events.

      <h3>Sport / Event Medal Distribution</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        Heatmap showing which sports and events produce the highest total number of medals.

        class="viz-img" 
        alt="Sport/event medal distribution heatmap"
      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        The heatmap highlights how certain sports dominate Olympic medal counts. 
        Athletics and swimming appear heavily saturated due to their many event categories, 
        while sports with fewer events, such as weightlifting or fencing, show lighter activity. 
        This explains why many countries invest strongly in multi-event sports to maximize their 
        medal potential.

  <h2>Preliminary Findings &amp; Future Work</h2>

  <p class="section-intro">
    As we complete the analysis, this section summarizes early insights from our static and interactive
    visualizations: shifts in global medal dominance, changes in gender representation, and how
    socio-economic factors may correlate with Olympic success.

    <!-- Finding 1 -->
    <article class="viz-card">
      <h3>1. Shifts in Global Medal Dominance</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        Early Olympics were dominated by European nations such as
        <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Great Britain</strong>, and <strong>Germany</strong>.
        By the mid–late 20th century, the <strong>United States</strong> and the
        <strong>Soviet Union (URS)</strong> became the two primary global leaders in medal count.
        In recent decades, <strong>China</strong> has risen sharply, especially after 2000,
        emerging as one of the top medal-winning nations.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- Finding 2 -->
    <article class="viz-card">
      <h3>2. Growth in Women’s Participation</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        From the early 1900s to the present, the number of women athletes has increased
        more than tenfold. Our gender participation charts show a steady upward trend beginning
        in the 1970s, with near-parity in recent Games. This reflects broader shifts in gender
        equity, expanded Olympic events for women, and policy changes that increased access to
        competitive sport worldwide.
      </p>

    <!-- Finding 3 -->
    <article class="viz-card">
      <h3>3. Changing Popularity of Sports &amp; Events</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        The event-level heatmap indicates that some sports, such as <strong>Basketball</strong>
        and <strong>Volleyball</strong>, have become more globally competitive over time.
        Traditional team events like <strong>Football</strong>, <strong>Hockey</strong>, and
        <strong>Water Polo</strong> show long-term continuity but with more countries earning medals
        in the last 40 years, suggesting a gradual diffusion of high-performance programs.
