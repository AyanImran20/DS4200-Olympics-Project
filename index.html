      <h2>Data Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our combined dataset includes 35,000+ medal-winning athlete records covering the Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to the most recent edition. 
        We merged three primary sources: the summer.csv, athlete dataset, the dictionary.csv country metadata (including GDP per capita and population),
        and the ISO_Codes.csv country code lookup. After merging and cleaning, the final table has more than 10 features (including Year, City, Sport, Event, 
        NOC/Country, Athlete Name, Medal Type, Gender, GDP per Capita, Population). This rich structure enables exploration of country performance, gender participation, 
        sports/ events trends, and socio-economic correlates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We integrate this file with <code>Dictionary.csv</code> (country metadata,
        GDP per capita, population) and <code>ISO_Codes.csv</code> (standardized
        country codes) to create a combined <strong>OLYMPICS Dataset</strong> that
        connects athlete performance to country-level characteristics.

  <h2>Static Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    This section presents static charts created in Python (Altair/Matplotlib)
    to provide an overview of Olympic medal trends.

      <h3>Medal Counts by Country Over Time</h3>
      <p class="viz-desc">
        Line chart showing how medal totals for major countries evolve across different Olympic years.
      </p>

      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        This visualization shows how global dominance in the Olympics has shifted over time. 
        The United States consistently leads total medal counts, while countries such as the Soviet Union 
        and China emerge as strong competitors in specific eras. Major geopolitical events — including 
        wars, boycotts, and national sports investments — strongly influence these trends.

        class="viz-img" 
        alt="Gender participation by year"
      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        Gender participation in the Olympics has risen dramatically over the last century. 
        While early Games were almost exclusively male, the number of female athletes grew sharply 
        after the 1970s. This reflects global gender equality movements and expanded Olympic policies 
        that increased women's access to competitive events.

        class="viz-img" 
        alt="Sport/event medal distribution heatmap"
      />

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        The heatmap highlights how certain sports dominate Olympic medal counts. 
        Athletics and swimming appear heavily saturated due to their many event categories, 
        while sports with fewer events, such as weightlifting or fencing, show lighter activity. 
        This explains why many countries invest strongly in multi-event sports to maximize their 
        medal potential.

                and interactive visualizations: shifts in global medal dominance, changes in gender

                <h4>1. Shifts in Global Medal Dominance</h4>
                <p>
                    Early Olympics were dominated by European nations such as <b>France</b>,
                    <b>Great Britain</b>, and <b>Germany</b>. By the mid–late 20th century, the
                    <b>United States</b> and the <b>Soviet Union</b> became the two primary global 
                    leaders. In recent decades, <b>China</b> has risen sharply, especially after 
                    the 2000s.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-card">
                <h4>2. Growth in Women’s Participation</h4>
                <p>
                    From the early 1900s to today, the number of women athletes has increased
                    more than tenfold. Participation grew especially after the 1970s, reflecting
                    greater gender equity and expanded Olympic opportunities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-card">
                <h4>3. Changing Popularity of Sports & Events</h4>
                <p>
                    Newer sports such as <b>Basketball</b> and <b>Volleyball</b> have become
                    increasingly competitive worldwide. Traditional sports like <b>Hockey</b> and
                    <b>Water Polo</b> remain consistent but show broader participation recently.

    <!-- Limitations section -->
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Early Olympic Games (pre-1950s) have inconsistent data records.</li>
        <li>Our dataset does not include Winter Olympics.</li>
        <li>Medal counts do not capture context such as population, GDP, or politics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrate socio-economic data (population, GDP, HDI).</li>
        <li>Add Winter Olympics for a full picture.</li>
        <li>Explore individual-athlete analytics and career evolution.</li>
