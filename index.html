      <h2>Data Description</h2>
      <p>
        Our combined dataset includes 35,000+ medal-winning athlete records covering the Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to the most recent edition. 
        We merged three primary sources: the summer.csv, athlete dataset, the dictionary.csv country metadata (including GDP per capita and population),
        and the ISO_Codes.csv country code lookup. After merging and cleaning, the final table has more than 10 features (including Year, City, Sport, Event, 
        NOC/Country, Athlete Name, Medal Type, Gender, GDP per Capita, Population). This rich structure enables exploration of country performance, gender participation, 
        sports/ events trends, and socio-economic correlates.
      </p>
      <p>
        We integrate this file with <code>Dictionary.csv</code> (country metadata,
        GDP per capita, population) and <code>ISO_Codes.csv</code> (standardized
        country codes) to create a combined <strong>OLYMPICS Dataset</strong> that
        connects athlete performance to country-level characteristics.

  <h2>Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    Our visualizations are organized by theme rather than by static/interactive type.
    Each group combines complementary charts so that country-level, gender, and sport-based
    trends can be compared side by side.
  </p>

  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <!-- Group 1: Country-Level Medal Trends (line + map)      -->
  <!-- ===================================================== -->
  <div class="viz-subsection">

    <p class="subsection-desc">
      These visualizations compare how different countries perform at the Olympics over time.

          />
        </a>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          This line chart shows that a small group of countries dominate Olympic medals. The United States
          consistently leads, while nations such as the Soviet Union and later China rise sharply in specific
          periods before stabilizing. Major geopolitical events (wars, boycotts, regime changes) often coincide
          with sudden jumps or drops in medal counts.

          countries across the world map.
        </p>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          The map reinforces the line chart findings: Olympic success clusters in North America, Western Europe,
          and a few powerful states like the Soviet Union and China. Over time, more countries begin to appear
          on the map with non-zero medal counts, reflecting the globalization of elite sport.

      <p class="viz-howto">
        <strong>How to use this visualization:</strong>
        Use the lasso tool (top-right toolbar) to drag around clusters of points and
        highlight specific countries or years. Selected points turn darker and larger,
        while unselected points fade, making it easier to compare medal counts across
        different regions and time periods.
      </p>

      <p class="viz-takeaway">
        <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
        This scatter plot shows how a small group of countries consistently appear at
        the top of the medal distribution, while many others earn only a few medals in
        occasional Games. The dense vertical bands for countries like the United States,
        Soviet Union, and Germany highlight long-term dominance, whereas sparse points
        reveal nations with more sporadic Olympic success.

        </a>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          Early Olympics were almost entirely male, but after the 1970s, women’s participation grows
          rapidly. By the 2000s, women make up a large share of total athletes, reflecting both policy
          changes at the IOC and broader global movements toward gender equality in sports.

          <strong>How to use this visualization:</strong>
          Use the year slider or play button to watch how the medal distribution changes over time.
          For any given year, compare the blue (Men) and red (Women) segments in each bar to see
          which sports are more balanced. Hover over a bar segment to see exact medal counts.
        </p>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          Women’s medal counts increase dramatically in later decades, particularly in athletics,
          swimming, and team sports. While men still dominate in some traditional events, many sports
          now show a much more equal split, confirming the trend seen in the participation chart.

        </a>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          Sports like athletics and aquatics stand out because they contain many medal events, leading
          to dense, saturated blocks in the heatmap. In contrast, niche sports with fewer events appear
          lighter, which helps explain why countries often invest heavily in multi-event sports to
          maximize overall medal potential.

          and medal count.
        </p>

        <p class="viz-takeaway">
          <strong>Takeaway:</strong>
          The sport-year heatmap shows that a few core sports consistently generate large numbers of
          medals across many decades, while others appear only in certain eras or fluctuate as events
          are added or removed. Darker cells highlight time periods when a sport was especially central
          to the Olympic program.

      <p class="section-intro">
        As we complete the analysis, this section summarizes early insights from our static and interactive
        visualizations: shifts in global medal dominance, changes in gender representation, and how
        socio-economic factors may correlate with Olympic success.

        <article class="viz-card">
          <h3>1. Shifts in Global Medal Dominance</h3>
          <p class="viz-desc">
            Early Olympics were dominated by European nations such as
            <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Great Britain</strong>, and <strong>Germany</strong>.
            By the mid–late 20th century, the <strong>United States</strong> and the
            <strong>Soviet Union (URS)</strong> became the two primary global leaders in medal count.
            In recent decades, <strong>China</strong> has risen sharply, especially after 2000,
            emerging as one of the top medal-winning nations.

        <article class="viz-card">
          <h3>2. Growth in Women’s Participation</h3>
          <p class="viz-desc">
            From the early 1900s to the present, the number of women athletes has increased
            more than tenfold. Our gender participation charts show a steady upward trend beginning
            in the 1970s, with near-parity in recent Games. This reflects broader shifts in gender
            equity, expanded Olympic events for women, and policy changes that increased access to
            competitive sport worldwide.

          <h3>3. Changing Popularity of Sports &amp; Events</h3>
          <p class="viz-desc">
            The event-level heatmap indicates that some sports, such as <strong>Basketball</strong>
            and <strong>Volleyball</strong>, have become more globally competitive over time.
            Traditional team events like <strong>Football</strong>, <strong>Hockey</strong>, and
            <strong>Water Polo</strong> show long-term continuity but with more countries earning medals
            in the last 40 years, suggesting a gradual diffusion of high-performance programs.
